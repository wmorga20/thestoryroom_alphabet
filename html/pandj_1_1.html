			<p>"Ahhhh! Ugh don't scare me like that Priscilla!"</p>
			<p> Priscilla loved teasing her younger sister, 
				especially on Halloween night. "Stop! Don't do that again or I'm telling mommy!" 
				"Whatever. Hurry up, are you ready yet?"
			</p>  
			<p>
				Priscilla had to take her sister Jade out for trick or treating. Priscilla was 14 and her sister was 5. 
				Priscilla felt like she was too old for trick or treating so instead she found her fun by scaring her sister.
