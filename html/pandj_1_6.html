			<p>"Yea yea yea orange lights, blrrrp!" Jade blew a raspberry.</p>
			<p>"Creepy house is waay cooler!" Jade suddenly sprinted toward the house, and before Priscilla could stop her she was at the front porch.</p>
			<p>"Jade!" Priscilla yelled in a panic. Jade turned around with a naughty grin toward her sister; then rang the doorbell. The sound that came out was so low and deep that Jade could feel the vibrations in her feet. A high pitch scream like sound flowed eerily along with the deep dark noise. Jade screamed and ran back to Priscilla, who without thinking, grabbed her sister's hand and ran back to the house.</p>
			<p>" Have fun ?" their mom said from the kitchen as she stirred a pot of chili.</p>
			<p>"Food will be ready in a few minutes you can eat ONE piece of candy Jade. You guys ok? You're being so quiet." Jade and Priscilla looked at one another and then simultaneously said, "we're fine." </p>
			<p>"Just tired, long night," Priscilla added. Priscilla walked up to her room still spooked out from the house.</p>
			<p>She began taking off her jacket when, "BOO!" A loud voice from behind Priscilla made her jump and scream.</p>
			<p>She caught her breath and then began to giggle, she knew that it was Jade getting pay back from when she scarred her earlier. Priscilla turned around expecting her sister but no one was there.</p>
			<p>Her heart pounded loudly in her chest.</p>
			<p>"Jade that's not funny!" Priscilla did not want to believe it; she began to make her way down the steps toward the living room. Her stomach dropped once she saw Jade laying down on the floor in front of the TV sorting her candy; she had not left the living room since they arrived.</p>
