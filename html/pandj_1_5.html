			<p>"Fine!" Jade said with a pout and her arms crossed."</p>
			<p>"We can go to the lights."</p>
			<p>Jade pointed and stomped towards the house. "Wow don't be so excited!"</p>
			<p>"Priscilla said laughing. Jade walked up the porch, with the same pout on her face, and rang the doorbell.
		  	Priscilla stood at a distance, relieved that they didn't go to the abandoned house.</p>
			<p>But then she noticed that one of the Jack-O-lanterns on the porch had an odd carving. 
				Then something strange happened, "Did that pumpkin just blink?"</p>
			<p>Priscilla said to herself. She watched it closer, and suddenly *wink.* It winked! Priscilla let out a small yelp.</p>
			<p>"Jade c'mon c'mon c'mon C'MON!" </p>
			<p>"Huh? What nowww?" whined Jade.</p>
			<p>"Just come here!" Priscilla was frantic.</p>
			<p>"Ugh Priscillaaaaaa." Priscilla pulled Jade by the hand, Jade reluctantly followed her sister.</p>
			<p>Priscilla walked quickly back to the house dragging her sister behind her. "I'm telling mommy on you! We still have some more houses to go to!"</p>
			<p>Jade ran inside. Priscilla didn't notice what Jade said she was too busy thinking about the blinking pumpkin. Priscilla was about to enter the front door to her house when she heard a loud thud from behind. She turned around, and to her surprise it was the pumpkin! She was struck frozen with fear, and then, *wink.*</p>
