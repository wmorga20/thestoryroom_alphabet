			<p>It was a cool night, laughter filled the air along with screams and the smell of roasting pumpkins.
				 Priscilla smiled to herself. She secretly loved this night. But this was no secret to her parents, which is why they have been telling Priscilla to take her sister Jade for the past two years.
				  Priscilla and Jade approached the first house. Pumpkins, Jack-o-lanterns, cobbwebs, and spiders adorned the lawn, followed by spooky music that played in the background.</p>
			<p>"Cool," said Priscilla under her breath.</p>
			<p>"Super cool!" Jade threw her arms up in excitement and ran towards the door slamming her hand down on the doorbell.</p>
			<p>"Oh my gosh Jade calm down."</p>
			<p>"No you calm down poopy head!" said Jade laughing hysterically.</p>
			<p>The door opened, "Who do we have here?"</p>
			<p>"Dracula!" said Jade beaming, she thrust out her bag and yelled, "Trick or Treat!" </p>
			<p>I love it! Here you go honey." "Thank you!" </p>
			<p>Jade skipped down the porch and back to her sister who was standing in the distance. "Ok next house! Talley ho!" yelled Jade.</p>
			<p>"Oh my gosh," said Priscilla with a smile.</p>
